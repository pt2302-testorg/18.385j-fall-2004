description: heatSln MATLAB function.  Demo illustrating the solution of the heat
  equation T_t = T_xx with periodic boundary conditions on 0 <= x <= 2*pi and  initial
  conditions u(x, 0) = F(x) as given by the same options in the fourierSC script (see
  help fourierSC for more information). A spectral method is used to solve the equation.
