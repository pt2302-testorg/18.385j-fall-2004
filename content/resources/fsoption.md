description: 'FSoption

  MATLAB function. Auxiliary script to compute a 2*pi periodic function of the array
  x   (which can be ROW array), in the interval 0 < x <= 2*pi.   Many options are
  offered via screen choices.   Used by both heatSln to provide initial values for
  the heat equation and by fourierSC, to study Fourier Series convergence.'
